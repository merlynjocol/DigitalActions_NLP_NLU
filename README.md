# Creating the Guidelines of Digital Actions for Social Impact. Combining Content Analysis, Text mining and Semantic Search

This repository is part of the HEIDI+ Project. 

The HEIDI project (Digital action at High Education institutions as a catalyst for social change) aspires to reposition HEIs with respect to society, as many traditional models of knowledge creation and circulation have shifted, challenged by bottom-up, community-driven action and the networking of individuals. 

The HEIDI project has the aim to transform the role of the HE into one involved in debates about social change and situate HEIs as co-creators of solutions to the problems that surface with the pandemic. HEIDI project seeks to create collaborative frameworks between HEIs, voluntary-sector organizations, and civic society organizations.

The consortium is composed of partners with complementary profiles: 3 HEIs (University of Malta, University of Paris, and the University College London), one SME (W2L, Greece), and one NGO (CIP, Cyprus). Each partner has an intellectual output. The University of Paris has the responsibility to build a set of
methodological guidelines for the design, implementation, and assessment of digital actions (materials needed, guidelines, tips, etc.), and the methodology for measuring the impact of Digital Actions (DA) awareness and training events, as well as the implementation of Digital actions.

In this project, the digital actions are the Citizen Science Project, the Maker Movement, and Hackathons/ Datathons.

## Objectives

Build the guidelines for digital actions using content analysis and text mining to gather information from stakeholder opinions, guidelines, scientific articles, and reports.

Specific objetives: 
- Collecting information from  the experience of the stakeholders in developing digital actions at the University of Paris, existing guidelines, scientific articles and reports
- Using content analysis and advance text mining to define the topics and gaps in methodologicla guidelines for digital actions


# Methods
The methodology follows the combination of content analysis, a qualitative analysis method working on
corpus from interviews and focus groups, and computational methods to mining scientific articles and
reports.

## Content analysis
The data used in the content analysis is not published in this repository for reasons of privacy and non  authorization to publish it. 

This method combines theory-based coding with explorative coding to create a hybrid coding design. Therefore, the coding structure includes both theoretically and empirically driven units of analysis, also referred to as deductive and inductive categories (Armborst, 2017).

### Process
● Reading the transcripts
● Create and define labels. Definitions with clear meaning
● Decide on the coding strategy.
● Label your research questions (code).
● search for relevant information in the data.
● create and define labels.

The coding approach entails breaking down the text into its constituent parts by coding small parts of the larger text into categories. This typically involves a researcher or team of researchers developing a codebook, or dictionary, with which to categorize text. This process is iterative.

The data came from interviews and focus groups. Label relevant words, phrases, sentences, or sections. Labels can be about actions, activities, concepts, differences, opinions, processes, or whatever you think is relevant.

### Tools
Taguette is a free open-source text tagging tool for qualitative data analysis and qualitative research.


## Topic modelling (LDA) - Identification of Topics in Guidelines

Topic modeling is a probabilistic model that identifies topics covered in text. The technique used  is categorized as an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA),  part of Python's Gensim package.
